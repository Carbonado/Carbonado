/**
 * Identifies alternate names for a {@link Storable} or a Storable property. An alias is used
 * only by a repository to link to entities. Without an alias, the repository will perform
 * a best guess at finding an entity to use. Aliases may be ignored by repositories that
 * don't require explicitly named entities.
 * <P>The most common use for an alias is for a JDBC repository, to link a storable to a table and
 * its properties to the corresponding columns.  Naming conventions for databases rarely work
 * well for class and variable names.
 *
 * <p>Example:<pre>
 * <b>&#64;Alias("USER_INFO")</b>
 * &#64;PrimaryKey("userInfoID")
 * public interface UserInfo extends Storable&lt;UserInfo&gt; {
 *     <b>&#64;Alias("USER_ID")</b>
 *     long getUserInfoID();
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
