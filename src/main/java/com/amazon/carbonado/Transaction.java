/**
 * Transactions define atomic operations which can be committed or aborted as a
 * unit. Transactions are entered by calling {@link Repository#enterTransaction()}.
 * Transactions are thread-local, and so no special action needs to be taken to
 * bind operations to them. Cursors which are opened in the scope of a
 * transaction are automatically closed when the transaction is committed or
 * aborted.
 *
 * <p>Transactions do not exit when they are committed. The transaction is
 * still valid after a commit, but new operations are grouped into a separate
 * atomic unit. The exit method <em>must</em> be invoked on every
 * transaction. The following pattern is recommended:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Transaction txn = repository.enterTransaction();
 * try {
 *     // Make updates to storage layer
 *     ...
 *
 *     // Commit the changes up to this point
 *     txn.commit();
 *
 *     // Optionally make more updates
 *     ...
 *
 *     // Commit remaining changes
 *     txn.commit();
 * } finally {
 *     // Ensure transaction exits, aborting uncommitted changes if an exception was thrown
 *     txn.exit();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Transactions may be nested. Calling commit or abort on an outer
 * transaction will recursively apply the same operation to all inner
 * transactions as well. All Cursors contained within are also closed.
 *
 * <p>Transaction instances are mutable, but they are thread-safe.
