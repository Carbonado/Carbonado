/**
 * Identifies that a {@link Storable} property can have a null value. By
 * default, all Storable properties are required to have a non-null value. It
 * is illegal to declare a property as nullable whose type is a primitive
 * non-object.
 *
 * <p>Example:<pre>
 * public interface UserInfo extends Storable&lt;UserInfo&gt; {
 *     <b>&#64;Nullable</b>
 *     String getName();
 *     void setName(String name);
 *
 *     ...
