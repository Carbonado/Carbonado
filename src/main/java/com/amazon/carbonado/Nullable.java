/**
 * Identifies that a {@link Storable} property can have a null value. By
 * default, all Storable properties are required to have a non-null value. It
 * is illegal to declare a property as nullable whose type is a primitive
 * non-object.
 *
 * <p>Example:<pre>
 * public interface UserInfo extends Storable&lt;UserInfo&gt; {
 *     <b>&#64;Nullable</b>
 *     String getName();
 *     void setName(String name);
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>If the repository does not allow a property to be declared as nullable
 * because the underlying schema differs, it can be also annotated as {@link
 * Independent}. This makes it easier for a common set of Storables to interact
 * with schemas which are slightly different. Attempting to persist null into a
 * property for which null is not allowed will likely result in a constraint
 * exception.
