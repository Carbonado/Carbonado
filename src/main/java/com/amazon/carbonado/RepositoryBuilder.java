/**
 * Standard interface for building up configuration and opening a {@link
 * Repository} instance. All repository implementations should be constructable
 * via a builder that implements this interface. Builders should follow a
 * pattern where configuration is supplied via property access methods. With
 * this design, each item can have extensive documentation and optional
 * configuration can be ignored.
 *
 * <p>A builder design also offers advantages over constructors in that a
 * different repository can be built depending on the specific
 * configuration. This logic is hidden, making it easier to use repositories
 * that would otherwise require complex steps to construct.
 *
 * <p>RepositoryBuilders are not expected to be thread-safe, but the
 * Repositories they build are thread-safe.
