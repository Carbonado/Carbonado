/**
 * An immutable tree structure representing a query result filter. Filters can
 * be created using a builder pattern, by expression parsing, or by a
 * combination of techniques. Filter instances are canonical, which means that
 * equivalent instances can be compared for equality using the '==' operator.
 *
 * <p>Any method that accepts a filter expression parses against the following
 * syntax:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Filter          = OrFilter
 * OrFilter        = AndFilter { "|" AndFilter }
 * AndFilter       = NotFilter { "&" NotFilter }

 * EntityFilter    = PropertyFilter
 *                 = ChainedFilter
 *                 | "(" Filter ")"
 * PropertyFilter  = ChainedProperty RelOp "?"
 * RelOp           = "=" | "!=" | "&lt;" | "&gt;=" | "&gt;" | "&lt;="
 * ChainedFilter   = ChainedProperty "(" [ Filter ] ")"
 * ChainedProperty = Identifier
