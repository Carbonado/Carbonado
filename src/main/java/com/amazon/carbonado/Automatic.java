/**
 * Identifies a {@link Storable} property capable of selecting its own value on
 * insert. The actual process by which a value is automatically assigned is
 * repository dependent. In the JDBC repository, the value might come from an
 * auto-increment column or a database-specific trigger.
 *
 * <p>If the underlying repository doesn't automatically supply a value to an
 * automatic property, no immediate warning is given and instead the property
 * will be assigned a default value of null or zero. This may cause problems if
 * the automatic property is a member of a key. Explicitly specifying a value
 * can sometimes be used to bypass the automatic value altogether.
 *
 * <p>Example:<pre>
 * &#64;PrimaryKey("userInfoID")
 * public interface UserInfo extends Storable&lt;UserInfo&gt; {
 *     <b>&#64;Automatic</b>
 *     long getUserInfoID();
 *     void setUserInfoID(long id);
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
