/**
 * Support for recording the evolution of a storable's layout, used internally
 * by some repositories. This allows storable's to evolve. Enough information
 * is recorded in the {@link com.amazon.carbonado.layout.Layout layout} such
 * that an older generation can be reconstructed, allowing it to be decoded
 * from persistent storage.
 *
 * <p>A storable generation is different than a storable {@link
 * com.amazon.carbonado.Version version}. The version increases with each
 * update of an <i>instance</i>, whereas the generation increases when the
 * storable type definition changes. The version number is stored with each
 * instance, and the generation is stored via the classes in this package.
 *
 * <p>Whenever a property is added or removed from a storable, the storable
 * layout is assigned a new generation value. If the storable layout reverts to
 * a previous generation's layout, no new generation value is created. Instead,
 * the generation value of the current storable will match the previous
 * generation.
 *
 * @see com.amazon.carbonado.layout.LayoutFactory
