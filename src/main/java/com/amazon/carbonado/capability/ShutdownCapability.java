     * Similar to calling close on a repository, except should only be called
     * when the virtual machine is in the process of shutting down. Calling
     * close may cause spurious exceptions to be thrown by other threads which
     * may be interacting with the repository. Shutdown tries to reduce these
     * exceptions from being thrown by effectively <i>suspending</i> any
     * threads which continue to interact with this repository. <b>For this
     * reason, this method should only ever be called during a virtual machine
     * shutdown.</b>
     *
     * <p>Repositories may choose to implement this method by simply calling
     * close. There is no guarantee that shutdown will reduce exceptions, and
     * it might not suspend any threads. Also, repositories that require proper
     * shutdown should automatically register runtime hooks, and so this method
     * usually doesn't need to be called manually.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException if caller does not have permission
