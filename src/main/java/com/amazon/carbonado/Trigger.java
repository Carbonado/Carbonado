/**
 * Callback mechanism to allow custom code to run when a storable is
 * persisted. By default, the methods defined in this class do
 * nothing. Subclass and override trigger conditions of interest, and then
 * {@link Storage#addTrigger register} it. Each overridden trigger method is
 * called in the same transaction scope as the persist operation. Trigger
 * implementations are encouraged to override the equals method, to prevent
 * accidental double registration.
 *
 * <p>To ensure proper nesting, all "before" events are run in the
 * <em>opposite</em> order that the trigger was registered. All "after" and
 * "failed" events are run in the same order that the trigger was registered.
 * In other words, the last added trigger is at the outermost nesting level.
 *
 * <p>Triggers always run within the same transaction as the triggering
 * operation. The exact isolation level and update mode is outside the
 * trigger's control. If an explicit isolation level or update mode is
 * required, create a nested transaction within a trigger method. A trigger's
 * nested transaction can also be defined span the entire triggering operation.
 * To do this, enter the transaction in the "before" method, but return the
 * transaction object without exiting it. The "after" method is responsible for
 * exiting the transaction. It extracts (or simply casts) the transaction from
 * the state object passed into it. When creating spanning transactions like
 * this, it is critical that the "failed" method be defined to properly exit
 * the transaction upon failure.
