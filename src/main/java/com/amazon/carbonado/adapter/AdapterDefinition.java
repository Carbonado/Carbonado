/**
 * Allows annotations to be defined for supporting property types which are not
 * natively supported by the underlying storage layer. Repositories must always
 * attempt to match property types to the best matching native type, but they
 * may have to rely on an adapter to make a conversion.
 *
 * <p>The annotation is just a pointer to an adapter implementation class. If
 * the adapter class is not explicitly provided, it defaults to a static inner
 * class named "Adapter" in the annotation itself.
 *
 * <p>The adapter class must have a public constructor that accepts the
 * annotation that has the AdapterDefinition annotation. It must also define
 * several adapt methods which convert property values. An adapt method needs
 * to start with "adapt", accept one parameter and return something.
 * <p>
 * Example true/false adapter for booleans:
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Documented
 * <b>&#64;Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)</b>
 * <b>&#64;Target(ElementType.METHOD)</b>
 * <b>&#64;AdapterDefinition</b>
 * public &#64;interface TrueFalseAdapter {
 *
 *     public static class Adapter {
 *         private final String propertyName;
 *
 *         // Constructor may throw a MalformedTypeException if
 *         // params supplied by annotation are illegal.
 *
 *         /**
 *          * @param type optional type of object that contains the adapted property
 *          * @param propertyName name of property with adapter
 *          * @param annotation specific annotation that binds to this adapter class
 *          *&#47;
 *         public Adapter(Class type, String propertyName, TrueFalseAdapter annotation) {
 *             this.propertyName = propertyName;
 *         }
 *
 *         // Define at least two adapt methods for each supported property type.
 *
 *         /**
 *          * @param propertyValue value to convert from
 *          *&#47;
 *         public char adaptToChar(boolean propertyValue) {
 *             return value ? 'T' : 'F';
 *         }
 *
 *         /**
 *          * @param propertyValue value to convert from
 *          *&#47;
 *         public boolean adaptToBoolean(char propertyValue) {
 *             if (propertyValue == 'T') { return true; };
 *             if (propertyValue == 'F') { return false; };
 *             throw new IllegalArgumentException
 *                 ("Cannot adapt '" + value + "' into boolean for property \"" +
 *                   propertyName + '"');
 *         }
 *     }
 * }

 *
 * The newly defined adapter can be applied to property accessors.
