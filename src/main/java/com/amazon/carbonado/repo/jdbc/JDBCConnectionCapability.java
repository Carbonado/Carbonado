/**
 * Capability to directly access the JDBC connection being used by the current
 * transaction, which is thread-local. If no transaction is in progress, then
 * the connection is in auto-commit mode.
 *
 * <p>All connections retrieved from this capability must be properly
 * yielded. Do not close the connection directly, as this interferes with the
 * transaction's ability to properly manage it.
 *
 * <p>It is perfectly okay for other Carbonado calls to be made while the
 * connection is in use.  Also, it is okay to request more connections,
 * although they will usually be the same instance. Failing to yield a
 * connection has an undefined behavior.
