/**
 * Identifies a {@link Storable} property which is not directly persisted, but
 * is instead derived from other property values. A derived property cannot be
 * abstract, and a "set" method is optional.
 *
 * <p>Derived properties can be used just like a normal property in most
 * cases. They can be used in query filters, indexes, alternate keys, and they
 * can also be used to define a {@link Version} property.
 *
 * <p>If the derived property depends on {@link Join} properties and is also
 * used in an index or alternate key, dependencies must be listed in order for
 * the index to be properly updated.
 *
 * <p>Example:<pre>
 * &#64;Indexes(&#64;Index("uppercaseName"))
 * public abstract class UserInfo implements Storable&lt;UserInfo&gt; {
 *     /**
 *      * Derive an uppercase name for case-insensitive searches.
 *      *&#47;
 *     <b>&#64;Derived</b>
 *     public String getUppercaseName() {
 *         String name = getName();
 *         return name == null ? null : name.toUpperCase();
 *     }
 *
 *     ...
 * }
