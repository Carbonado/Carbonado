/**
 * A convenience class for repositories to run dynamic repairs in separate
 * threads. When a repository detects a consistency error during a user
 * operation, it should not perform the repair in the same thread.
 *
 * <p>If the repair was initiated by an exception, but the original exception
 * is re-thrown, a transaction exit will rollback the repair! Executing the
 * repair in a separate thread allows it to wait until the transaction has
 * exited.
 *
 * <p>Other kinds of inconsistencies might be detected during cursor
 * iteration. The repair will need to acquire write locks, but the open cursor
 * might not allow that, resulting in deadlock. Executing the repair in a
 * separate thread allows it to wait until the cursor has released locks.
 *
 * <p>This class keeps thread-local references to single-threaded executors. In
 * other words, each user thread has at most one associated repair thread. Each
 * repair thread has a fixed size queue, and they exit when they are idle. If
 * the queue is full, newly added repair tasks are silently discarded.
 *
 * <p>The following system properties are supported:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>com.amazon.carbonado.spi.RepairExecutor.keepAliveSeconds (default is 10)
 * <li>com.amazon.carbonado.spi.RepairExecutor.queueSize (default is 10000)
 * </ul>
