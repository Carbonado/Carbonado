/**
 * Identifies a {@link Storable} property capable of selecting its own value on
 * insert, by a named sequence. Support for sequences is repository dependent,
 * and if not supported, a {@link PersistException} is thrown when trying to
 * insert. Explicitly specifying a value bypasses the sequence altogether.
 *
 * <p>Example:<pre>
 * &#64;PrimaryKey("userInfoID")
 * public interface UserInfo extends Storable&lt;UserInfo&gt; {
 *     <b>&#64;Sequence("USER_ID_SEQ")</b>
 *     long getUserInfoID();
 *     void setUserInfoID(long id);
 *
 *     ...
 * }
