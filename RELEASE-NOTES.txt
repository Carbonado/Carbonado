Carbonado change history
------------------------

1.1-BETA9 to 1.1-BETA10
-------------------------------
- JDBCSupportStrategy cleans up database product name before using it to
  determine custom support strategy class name.
- Added additional index selection tie-breaker if index is most likely defined
  to support desired ordering.
- Support mapping JDBC numeric column to short or byte.
- Index removal is now batched - reducing memory requirements when removing
  large indexes.
- Fixed bug when filtering against negative floating point values.

1.1-BETA8 to 1.1-BETA9
-------------------------------
- Fixed bug in JDBC repository which caused cursor skip to skip everything.
- Fix for getting supplied filter values when duplicate property filters exist.
- Fixes for bugs found using FindBugs.

1.1-BETA7 to 1.1-BETA8
-------------------------------

  is converted to zero or false instead of throwing a NullPointerException.

1.1-BETA6 to 1.1-BETA7
-------------------------------
