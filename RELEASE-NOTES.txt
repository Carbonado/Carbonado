Carbonado change history
------------------------

1.1-BETA10 to 1.1-BETA11
-------------------------------
- Fixed bug when decoding old Storable generations - new properties must be
  cleared. Otherwise, indexes on newly added properties might not get updated.

1.1-BETA9 to 1.1-BETA10
-------------------------------
- JDBCSupportStrategy cleans up database product name before using it to
  determine custom support strategy class name.
- Added additional index selection tie-breaker if index is most likely defined
  to support desired ordering.
- Support mapping JDBC numeric column to short or byte.
- Index removal is now batched - reducing memory requirements when removing
  large indexes.
- Fixed bug when filtering against negative floating point values.
- Fixed multiple cursor implementations to be extra paranoid and close the
  cursor when an exception is thrown.
- Fixed JDBC cursor implementation to close the connection when an exception is
  thrown during cursor construction.

1.1-BETA8 to 1.1-BETA9
-------------------------------
- Fixed bug in JDBC repository which caused cursor skip to skip everything.
- Fix for getting supplied filter values when duplicate property filters exist.
- Fixes for bugs found using FindBugs.

1.1-BETA7 to 1.1-BETA8
-------------------------------
- Removed call to get index metadata in JDBC repository. Oracle bug causes a
  table analyze to run.
- When a property evolves from a boxed primitive to an unboxed primitive, null
  is converted to zero or false instead of throwing a NullPointerException.
- Support write-no-sync mode for Sleepycat repositories.

1.1-BETA6 to 1.1-BETA7
-------------------------------
- Added @Authoritative annotation.
- ReplicatedRepository installs user triggers on the master, not the
  replica. This fixes errors caused by resync running user triggers.

1.1-BETA5 to 1.1-BETA6
-------------------------------
- Added automatic repair for broken layout metadata.
- Add Storable to CorruptEncodingException when loading from index.
- Fix conversion of null lobs.
- Query filter constants appear as SQL constants.

1.1-BETA4 to 1.1-BETA5
-------------------------------
- More fixes in resync corruption repair logic.
- Fixed deadlock when using unsupported Storage for the first time.

1.1-BETA3 to 1.1-BETA4
-------------------------------
- Added additional repair logic in resync if replica entries are corrupt.
- ConstraintException thrown when inserting uninitialized properties now
  includes property names in the exception message.

1.1-BETA2 to 1.1-BETA3
-------------------------------
- Fixed exception when printing join plan with blank parameters.
- Added isolation level of "none" to indicate that transaction is auto-commit.

1.1-BETA to 1.1-BETA2
-------------------------------
- Inner joins in generated SQL use more compliant syntax.
- Fixed deadlocks during replicated respository resync.
