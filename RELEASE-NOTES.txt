Carbonado change history
------------------------

1.1-BETA7 to 1.1-BETA8
-------------------------------

  table analyze to run.
- When a property evolves from a boxed primitive to an unboxed primitive, null
  is converted to zero or false instead of throwing a NullPointerException.

-------------------------------
- Added @Authoritative annotation.
